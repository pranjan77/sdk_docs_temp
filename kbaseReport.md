[KBaseReport](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBaseReport) allows the creation of KBase 
reports which can present text, html, and downloadable files to the user as output to your app.


The KBaseReports module is the preferred way to communicate results to users. The example module contains a minimal use
case where a string is displayed to the user (supplied in the 'text_message' field) along with links to new objects 
created by the app (supplied in the 'objects_created' field). However this module also contains functionality to create 
and display HTML webpages and serve files directly for user download. A more typical and feature rich example can be
found in KBase's implementation of [Ballgown](https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_ballgown/blob/1b77c87/lib/kb_ballgown/core/ballgown_util.py#L66-L167)

To save space, an annotated copy of the master function is copied below:
```python
def _generate_report(self, params, result_directory, diff_expression_matrix_set_ref):
        """
        _generate_report: generate summary report
        """
        print('creating report')
        # Files to be presented directly to the user are copied to a output directory, zipped and returned as a list of paths
        output_files = self._generate_output_file_list(result_directory)
        
        # A folder for the display web page is created(L74 in ballgown repo linked above), reference data (could also be 
        # embedded images) for the page are copied in(L78), custom html is generated(L81-95), template is updated with 
        # custom html(L98-104), the complete web page is saved to SHOCK which will serve the data(L106) and an object with 
        # that reference is returned(L109)
        output_html_files = self._generate_html_report(result_directory, params, diff_expression_matrix_set_ref)

        report_params = {
              'message': '',
              'workspace_name': params.get('workspace_name'),
              'file_links': output_files,
              'html_links': output_html_files,
              'direct_html_link_index': 0,
              'html_window_height': 333,
              'report_object_name': 'kb_ballgown_report_' + str(uuid.uuid4())}
        
        # Make the client, generate the report
        kbase_report_client = KBaseReport(self.callback_url)
        output = kbase_report_client.create_extended_report(report_params)
        # Return references which will allow inline display of the report in the Narrative
        report_output = {'report_name': output['name'], 'report_ref': output['ref']}

        return report_output
```
